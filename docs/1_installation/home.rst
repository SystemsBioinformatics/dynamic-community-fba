1. Installation and Requirements
================================

Prerequisites
-------------
The dynamic-community-fba package utilizes the CBMPy library [#ref_cbmpy]_ for managing constraint-based metabolic models. Similar to 
`COBRApy` [#ref_cobra]_, `CBMPy` is a Python package designed for loading, creating, and manipulating constraint-based models. 
Furthermore, it streamlines the interaction with linear program solvers, such as `CPLEX` [#ref_cplex]_.

To install `CBMPy`, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install cbmpy

For more information and detailed documentation on using `CBMPy`, please refer to the `CBMPy GitHub repository`_ and the `CBMPy documentation`_.

Please make sure `CBMPy` is up and running correctly before preceding with the analyses provided by `dcFBA`.

Dynamic Community FBA
---------------------

After the installation of `CBMPy` you can install dynamic community FBA using the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dcFBA

.. Maybe we can write some easy converter functions for known maps. To display the models
.. have to think about this
